# Overview 
During this festive time of the year, many people struggle with keeping track of all the gifts and their costs for their friends and family.
That is why I wanted to create a Google extension for Christmas lists! I call this extension: Checkmas.
Not only will this extension track a list for one person, my goal is to be able to add a component which allows multiple lists for different people.

# Current Status 

The video below demonstrates the current features of the extension. 

# Objectives 
- Have a home page with access to lists, a budget, and money spent features 
- Allow the creation of multiple christmas lists 
- Budget will be inputed by the user, and will decrease every time someone checks off an item
- Money spent will show how much the user has spent so far
- Would also like to store data in Google storage api so it doesn not get lost after closing the extension or refreshing the page 
- In future versions, I would like to include other holidays as well (including birthays).
- Each holiday will have its own theme 

# Advantages of Project 
Not only will I, and hopefully others, be able to use this extension, it is a great learning experience as well. Progressing through this project is allowing
me to strengthen my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills. In addition, I am now very comfrotable intergrating with Google Extensions. Once I complete Checkmas, 
I will know how to work with Google's storage api.
